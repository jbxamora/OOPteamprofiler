# OOPteamprofiler
This script is a command-line interface (CLI) tool that generates an HTML page displaying a software development team's information. It uses inquirer to prompt users to add employees to the team, with the type of employee (Manager, Engineer, or Intern) selected by the user. The employee data entered is then used to create objects of Manager, Engineer, or Intern classes (which are required from separate files), and these objects are added to an array 'team'. Once the user is done adding employees, the 'buildHTML' function is called to generate the HTML file by writing the output of the 'generateTeam' function to the file system. The 'generateTeam' function uses the 'team' array data to create the HTML output.

## User Story

```md
AS A manager
I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles
```

## Acceptance Criteria
```md
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information
THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input
WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML
THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address
WHEN I click on the GitHub username
THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab
WHEN I start the application
THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team
WHEN I select the engineer option
THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu
WHEN I select the intern option
THEN I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu
WHEN I decide to finish building my team
THEN I exit the application, and the HTML is generated
```
